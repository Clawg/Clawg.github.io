                <h1 class="h2">HTC Hero vs Nokia N97</h1>
                <p>After 6 months of frustration I have decided to bite the bullet and get rid of my Nokia N97 and replace it with the HTC  Hero.  Nokia’s flagship device of 2009 is a big failure and here are a few reasons why:</p>
                <h2 class="h3">Setting Up</h2>
                <p>I wrote a post about 5 months ago detailing the <a href="nokia-n97-for-osx.html">problems I had trying to set up my N97</a> and get everything synced up with my mac, I wont go into all of that again you can read the post.  To sync up the HTC I turned it on, entered my email address for a few accounts and that was it.  My mail, calendar, bookmarks, feeds, twitter, facebook and contacts were all in my phone and ready to go.</p>
                <h2 class="h3">Touch Screen</h2>
                <p>The resistive touch of the N97 just doesn’t make sense.  Why a smart phone would require you to press hard to make stuff happen is beyond me.  At first I liked this since it was my first touch screen, but now I think different.  The HTC is quick, responsive and iphone like in every way.  Furthermore, If you are not big on the whole touch screen there is even a wee track ball you can use, though I don’t find myself using it much at the moment.</p>
                <h2 class="h3">Web browsing</h2>
                <p>The Web browsing experience is night and day.  I think this is down to the touch screen of the HTC which makes the whole ease of browsing a much nicer experience.  I find myself sitting on the phone at home browsing on my HTC instead of booting up the laptop now.  Added to that I have installed Dolphin browser which allows swiping backwards and forwards between pages and tabbed browsing, all of which make if a more desktop browser like experience.</p>
                <h2 class="h3">Apps</h2>
                <p>Both phones offer the ability to expand with loads of apps but the Ovi stores is a poor mans app store.  Its clunky and difficult to navigate, whereas I have found android marketplace simple to use, with an overwhelming amount of choice with loads of free apps.</p>
                <p>The N97 came with 32gb hard-drive but installed apps in the small RAM space.  Now you can change this to save on the hard-drive but this RAM will still quickly run out as your cache builds from web browsing.  This is not a problem if you are prepared to hard reset the phone every 2 months (please not sarcasm)</p>
                <h2 class="h3">Reliability</h2>
                <p>The N97 would take it upon itself to turn off when it felt like it, for no reason and with no warning. The phone would crash when I put it into flight mode to listen to the music player at night and I would sometimes get a multi coloured screen and a line running down the middle every now and then.</p>
                <p>After a bit of use the N97 stopped auto rotating when I opened the keyboard, I had to shake the phone to tell it to rotate.  When it did rotate the phone didn’t recognise I was wanting to use the keyboard so when you pressed the keys the wrong text appeared.</p>
                <p>So far the HTC has just worked. The battery life is poor but I can live with this.</p>
                <h2 class="h3">Operating system</h2>
                <p>Symbian vs Android. In a nut shell Symbian feels like a fancy phones operating system whereas Android is a light desktop.</p>
                <h2 class="h3">Music Player</h2>
                <p>The music player interface on the N97 is a poor user experience.  Its pretty much just a list of artists whereas the HTC has a nice visually interface similar to the ipod. </p>
                <h2 class="h3">N97 good things (sort of)</h2>
                <p>Now don’t get me wrong the N97 does offer a few advantages.  I really liked the keyboard when it worked and it has an FM radio.  The camera has a flash which is a big miss from the Hero, however the N97 flash comes with problems as it suffers from an issue called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTvgV6uWkyA">flash flood</a> which you can fix by colouring in your phone with a permanent marker.  £500 pound device + pernament marker = WTF</p>
                <h2 class="h3">Summary</h3>
                <p>Don’t but an N97, life is to short.</p>
