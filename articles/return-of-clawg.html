                <h1 class="h2">Site rebuild</h1>
                <p>Like a Phoneix from the flames the Clawg Blog has risen once more.  Formely on clawg.co.uk my hosting lapsed during my immigration to New Zealand, but thanks to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/">wayback machine</a> I have managed to salvage most of my old content.</p>
                <p>As part of the resurrection I've recoded the blog and tried out a few new techniques along the way.  Techniques that I want to add to my workflow in my new job with the <a href="http://nzpost.co.nz">New Zealand Post</a>.  So what's new?</p>

                <h2 class="h3">SASS</h2>
                <p>I now preprocess the CSS using SASS.  I've used LESS on several projects but SASS intrigured me as it feels there's a larger community behind it than LESS.</p>
                <p>I've enjoyed the shift, I feel SASS is more powerful than LESS. The features like silent classes, more programing like syntax, the breakpoint handling and of cousre Compass make this a real winner for me.</p>
                <p>The SASS v LESS debate reminds me of the browser wars or framework wars and I am backing SASS to win this one.</p>
                <p>The use of SAAS or LESS really helps with responsive design.  They make the maths involved in setting column widths and gutters much easier and changing values is simple.</p>
                <p>Another bonus for SASS is the <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">SUSY grid system</a> it's an excellent SASS plugin for putting reponsive grids together quickly.</p>

                <h3 class="h3"><del>OO CSS</del> OO SCSS</h3>
                <p>This is one of the things I love about SASS.  You can use the @extend or even better $silent class to add presentational values without messing with the markup and keeping the classnames semantic.</p>
                <p><a href="http://ianstormtaylor.com/oocss-plus-sass-is-the-best-way-to-css/">This article</a> explain it well.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">Mobile First</h2>
                <p>Whilst the old site was responsive it was never built mobile first and you could tell, the mobile version was a bit half arsed whereas the newer version takes into consideration several breakpoints and conditional loading of content (sidebars).</p>

                <h2 class="h3">New section</h2>
                <p>I've added a work section that showcases some of the projects I have been working on.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">CSS3</h2>
                <p>More CSS3 fun with the use of <code>:nth-child()</code> pseudo selector.  I like this bad boy <code>li:nth-child(3n-5)</code> which selects every 4th item, <a href="http://css-tricks.com/how-nth-child-works/">Chris Coyier explains it well</a>.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">Using Normalise</h2>
                <p>instead of using a CSS reset I gave Normalise a shot.  The jury is still out on this one for me, I find that I can end up overwritting more styling than I would with the reset, but I like the text size and line spacing you get out the box.</p>

                <h2 class="h3">No more Wordpress</h2>
                <p>I just dont need the hassle of setting up a Wordpress template again.  I figured I could spend hours disecting Wordpress templates or just get on with it, so that what I done.  If I feel the need for CMS in the future I will just <a hre"http://grabaperch.com/">Perch it up</a></p>

                <h2 class="h3">Previous updates</h2>
                <p>This adds to some of the features I mentioned in a previous post:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Made use of CSS3 sudo selctor :last-child</li>
                    <li>Added trasparency to the content areas with CSS3 rgba</li>
                    <li>Drop shadows with CSS3</li>
                    <li>No more DD roundies for non ie users. Round corners are now handled with CSS3 border-radius</li>
                    <li>Pages now validate, it took a while to disect all the crap that was in wordpress but I got there</li>
                    <li>I added some new fonts. I started experimenting with typekit but after coming across the issue related to the flash of unstyled text I decided to simply use @font-face instead.</li>
                    <li>text-shadow has been added to some headers</li>
                    <li>Moved a lot of unnecessay markup and made some of the existing markup more semantic. There is still a few bits to go on this one.</li>
                    <li>Moved the dependancy of JavaScript for the twitter update which now uses PHP</li>
                    <li>Multiple backgroud images</li>
                </ul>
