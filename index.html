						<p>I have been developing a few mobile sites recently and want to document the things I have found out along the way. Keep it relative &#8211; Use percentages for horizontal widths and em&#8217;s for vertical padding and margins. I have found this to be the most consistent way of getting results without pixels.

						<p>I have updated this site with a few techniques that I have been reading about in the web dev community. Some of them are pretty obvious and others are simply code tweeks.

						<time datetime="2009-09-27">September 28th, 2009</time> <!-- by CharlieLaw -->
						<p>Sites that need to generate ad revenue are often littered with ad scripts throughout the HTML.  If these ads break or take a while to download it can delay the time it takes your site to appear.  It would make more sense to serve the ads as the last item in the document, thus allowing all page content to load first.  After all the user has not came to your site to see your ads. </p>
